# EntityHttp JSON

These package allows you to make http requests without having to configure an http client from scratch, and only worry about using your .NET requests and responses models, or use directly your .NET domain models.

The EntityHttp Json package alows you to work with APIs that receive requests with JSON values, APIs that response with JSON values, or do both.
